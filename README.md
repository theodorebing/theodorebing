On my Github account you will find the first repositories I've created months ago 
when I began to learn 

**HTML/CSS** and then **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **React**, **Redux** and much more!
  
So you will be able to see how I progressed and where am I today in my neverending learning process.
Contact me and I'll be pleased to answer any question or suggestion ;-)
