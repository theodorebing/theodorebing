<h1 align="center" color="blue" font-size="46px">Hi, I’m @theodorebing</h1>

- :floppy_disk: I’m a **Fullstack Developper** using *JavaScript*, *node.js* and *React*, and I'm interested in learning new languages and frameworks.
- :two_men_holding_hands: I’m looking to collaborate on every project that's challenging to me.
- :mailbox_with_mail: How to reach me : theodorebing.dev@gmail.com / https://www.linkedin.com/in/theodorebing/

Here you'll find past repositories I've worked on during my schooling and personnal projects I've created on my own with
**HTML/CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **React**, **Redux** and much more!
  
So you will be able to follow my footsteps in this neverending learning process.
